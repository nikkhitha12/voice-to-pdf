# 🎤 Speech to Text Converter (Learning Project)

A simple **web-based Speech to Text Converter** built using **JavaScript** and the **Web Speech API**.  
This project was developed as a **learning and practice project** to understand real-time speech recognition in web applications.

---

## 📌 Description
The application allows users to convert their **voice into text in real time**.  
Users can start or stop speech recognition, select different languages, copy the generated text, or download it as a file.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with **browser APIs, JavaScript DOM manipulation, and event handling**.
